                   <h2>Our Story</h2>
                   <p>Over 70% of homeowners tackle DIY projects to save money around the house but many feel their way through the dark by watching television shows, scouring the Internet, or simply asking a friend. Patched was founded in 2016 on the simple principle that there’s got to be a better way of doing this.  We found that DIYers like us seek professional advice in a convenient on-demand setting, but that nothing was really meeting our needs. At the same time, many home repair experts nearing retirement were looking for more flexible schedules and opportunities to earn additional income and we recognized that we’d be able to help connect the two sides of the home repair equation. Since then, we’ve been putting our idea into practice with friends and family, enthusiastic DIYers, and home repair experts to make sure that the service seamlessly integrates with your home repair projects and we’re excited for you to give us a try.</p>
